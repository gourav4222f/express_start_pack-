# Express Basic Pack

## Introduction

Express Basic Pack is a pre-configured project setup for Express.js applications. It provides a solid foundation for starting new projects, eliminating the need to repeatedly set up common configurations and folder structures. This pack includes essential setups for:

- Express server
- Environment variables with dotenv
- Sequelize ORM configuration
- Organized folder structure

By using this pack, you can jumpstart your Express.js projects and focus on building your application logic rather than spending time on initial setup.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a well-organized folder structure:

```
express-basic-pack/
├── src/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── migrations/
│   ├── seeders/        
│   ├── repositories/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── utils/
│   └── app.js
├── tests/
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md   
```

- `src/`: Contains the main application code
  - `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., database.js)
  - `controllers/`: Request handlers
  - `models/`: Sequelize model definitions
  - `migrations/`: Sequelize database migration files
  - `seeders/`: Sequelize seed data files
  - `repositories/`: Data access layer
  - `routes/`: Express route definitions
  - `services/`: Business logic layer
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `app.js`: Main Express application file
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `.env`: Environment variables (not tracked in git)
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files
- `package.json`: Project metadata and dependencies
- `README.md`: Project documentation

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns and follows best practices for organizing an Express.js application with Sequelize ORM, including dedicated directories for database migrations and seed data.
